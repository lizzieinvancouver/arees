Meeting with Elsa on 8 January 2024:
- Figures
- Moving around my text chunks and last section
	-> I think trait correlations would fit well after the priority effects section, with just a little tweaking (move it)
- Need an abstract
- When we get it to friendly review


10 Jan 2024: Cutting refs
On the text, I copied the main text into word and see we have a 6700 word count, and the instructions say each figure is about 600 words (4 figures =2400 words), so we'd be at about 9100 (with an 8500 limit). Hence, in whatever changes we make, we should cut about 600 words or one figure (but I like the figures). Or at least reduce by say 300 words so we're close? I can think about what I'd cut, I'm sure I can drop a few references as well as sentence here or there, or make a sentence more active to use fewer words.
