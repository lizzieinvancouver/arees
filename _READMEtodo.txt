Meeting with Elsa on 8 January 2024:
- Figures
- Moving around my text chunks and last section
	-> I think trait correlations would fit well after the priority effects section, with just a little tweaking (move it)
- Need an abstract
- When we get it to friendly review


(Formerly notes from reading Elsa's part)

- Add very quick abstract

- Check Cowan Bolmgren and fix it... Davies et al. 2019 and general idea that we need cues instead of DOY (progression of the literature).  
- Figure of annual/deciduous tree/evergreen tree 

Can I sneak this into the coexistence section? 


To maintain our focus on community assembly, we have not included studies that focus on single species, nor on purely ecosystem-level measures of phenology. While trophic mismatch \citep{kharouba2018global} is a potential outcome of shifting species phenology in response to global change, it is beyond the scope of this review. We also will not discuss how , nor the specific cues that underlie phenological transitions.

I didn't end up adding text for the Bazzaz ref, as I thought it fit with text we already had -- so I just referenced it. But I could add a sentence more explicitly about life history predicts annual to perennial, but also within season to the paragraph starting 'Integrating across intra- and inter-annual timescales is a common ...' (Let me know if you think I should.
