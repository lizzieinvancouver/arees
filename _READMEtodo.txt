Meeting with Elsa on 8 January 2024:
- Figures
- Moving around my text chunks and last section
	-> I think trait correlations would fit well after the priority effects section, with just a little tweaking
- Need an abstract
- My few notes on her text
- When we get it to friendly review


Notes from reading Elsa's part
- Can we not cite Stuble 2021 (cited once)? The science and stats of this paper are really poor and I would prefer not to cite it. 
- Can we change 'it is beyond the scope of this review' a little? More to 'we consider it beyond our focus given several recent reviews already (CITE)' (and generally this whole paragraph, feels too much like just 'we're not doing this' instead of 'we're doing this, so we're not doing this.'
