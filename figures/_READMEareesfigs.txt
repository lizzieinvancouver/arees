For FigResourceApr2023.pdf REAL data plot, I feel like one of the Jornada plots would be best. Jornada rains are usually July - September. 

Maybe: jornada_2014_302 or jornada_2020_302

Possibly relevant chapter: https://academic.oup.com/book/41712/chapter-abstract/353970995?redirectedFrom=fulltext

I asked Justin Ngo and Julie Sieg to help with finding real data for the conceptual community assembly figure. They each made repos:

Justin Ngo: https://github.com/ngoj1/arizonamoisture
Julie Sieg: https://github.com/JulieSieg/Soil-Moisture

Justin worked on the Jornada LTER and SRER ... the SRER does not seem to have soil moisture data though, so not useful methinks. Jornada data seemed to me to be the cleanest. 

Julie worked on SEV LTER and some on Andrus22 (LTER in Coloredo). SEV has a lot of different ways to measure things:
Moore23 - "gypsum block and said that the positive values moisture values should be negative"
Gosz16

I put clones of their repos and relevant notes in annualreview_soilmoisture on 7 Sep 2023
